                <h2 class="poppins text-[2rem] font-bold">Campaigning Tool Refund Policy</h2>
                <p class="inder">This policy is designed to be fair and reasonable, ensuring that customers feel secure in their transactions with Campaigning Tool, while also protecting the company from potential abuse of the refund process.</p>

                <ol class="inder">
                    <li><strong>Trial Period</strong><br />
                        Campaigning Tool offers a 1-day free trial for new users, during which they can explore the Basic Plan features available on the platform along with a 1-day free trial of Chatbot Flows (add-on). Since no credit card is required to start the trial, users are not charged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subscription Services</strong><br />
                        Following the free trial, if a user subscribes to any of Campaigning Tool’s paid services, they are ineligible to receive a refund. The FREE trial is provided to ensure that users can try out all the services and decide whether to continue with the Campaigning Tool platform. If the user feels unsatisfied, they can cancel their FREE Trial anytime, and they will not be charged. If the user has subscribed to any Campaigning Tool plan, they are not eligible for a refund. They can cancel their subscription to ensure they are not charged the next month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Refundable Services</strong><br />
                        All Campaigning Tool services, such as the charges for a Campaigning Tool Plan, WhatsApp Conversation Credits (WCCs), Add-ons, or any third-party integrations, are non-refundable due to the nature of the service and the costs incurred by Campaigning Tool to provide these services. This includes one-time Chatbot development and other one-time setup payments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Issues</strong><br />
                        If a user experiences continuous technical issues that prevent them from using the service effectively, and if these issues are verified by Campaigning Tool’s support team, a partial or full refund may be granted at Campaigning Tool’s discretion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unauthorized Charges</strong><br />
                        In the case of unauthorized or fraudulent charges, users should contact Campaigning Tool support immediately. If such claims are verified, Campaigning Tool will issue a full refund.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cancellation Policy</strong><br />
                        A user may cancel their subscription at any time. However, the cancellation will be effective at the end of the current billing cycle, and users will not receive a refund for the remaining period of the subscription, except under special circumstances that will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact and Support</strong><br />
                        For any refund-related queries, users are encouraged to contact Campaigning Tool’s customer support team, which is committed to providing efficient and personalized assistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refund Process</strong><br />
                        To request a refund, users should write to us at <a href="mailto:support@campaigningtool.com">support@campaigningtool.com</a>. The request must include the transaction details and a clear explanation of the reason for the refund request.</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Amendments</strong><br />
                        Campaigning Tool reserves the right to modify this refund policy at any time, and the changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated policy on the Campaigning Tool website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong><br />
                        This refund policy complies with the local laws and regulations where Campaigning Tool operates. Users are also encouraged to review the
